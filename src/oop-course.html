        <p>
          A popular interview question concerns the four core concepts in
          object-oriented programming. This concepts are encapsulation,
          abstraction, inheritance and polymorphism. Let's look at each of these
          concepts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before object-oriented programming we had procedure of programming
          that divided a program into a set of functions. So we have data stored
          in a bunch of variables and functions that operate on the data. This
          style of programming is very simple and straightforward. Often it's
          what you learn as part of your first programming subject at a
          university. But as your programs grow it will end up with a bunch of
          functions that are all over the place you might find yourself copying
          and pasting lines of code over and over you make a change to one
          function and then several other functions break that's what we call
          spaghetti code there is so much interdependence between all these
          functions. It becomes problematic object-oriented programming came to
          solve this problem in object-oriented programming we combine a group
          of related variables and functions into a unit we call that unit an
          object we refer to these variables as properties and the functions as
          methods here's an example think of a car a car is an object with
          properties such as make model and color and methods like start stop
          and move now you might say what marche we don't have cars in our
          programs give me a real programming example ok think of the local
          storage object in your browser's every browser has a local storage
          object that allows you to store data locally this local storage object
          has a property like length which returns the number of objects in the
          storage and metals like set item and remove item so in object-oriented
          programming we group related variables and functions that operate on
          them into objects and this is what we call encapsulation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me show you an example of this in action. So here we have three
          variables base salary over time and rate below. These we have a
          function to calculate the wage for an employee we refer to this kind
          of implementation as procedural. So we have variables on one side and
          functions on the other side they're hard decoupled now let's take a
          look at the object-oriented way to solve this problem we can have an
          employee object with three properties a salary over time and rate and
          a method called get wage now why is this better? Well first of all
          look at the get wage function, this function has no parameters. In
          contrast in a procedural example our get wage function has three
          parameters the reason in this implementation we don't have any
          parameters is because all these parameters are actually modeled as
          properties of this object. all these properties and the get wage
          function they are highly related so they are part of one unit so one
          of the symptoms of procedural code is functions with so many
          parameters when you write code in an object-oriented way your
          functions end up having fewer and fewer parameters as Uncle Bob says
          the best functions are those with no parameters the fewer the number
          of parameters the easier it is to use and maintain that function so
          that's encapsulation now let's look at abstraction think of a DVD
          player as an object this DVD player has a complex logic board on the
          inside and a few buttons on the outside that you interact with you
          simply press the play button and you don't care what happens on the
          inside all that complexity is hidden from you this is abstraction.
        </p>
        <p>
          In practice we can use the same technique in our objects. So we can
          hide some of the properties and methods from the outside and this
          gives us a couple of benefits. First is that we'll make the interface
          of those objects simpler using an understanding an object with a few
          properties and methods is easier than an object with several
          properties and methods the second benefit is that it helps us reduce
          the impact of change let's imagine that tomorrow we change these inner
          or private methods these changes will leak to the outside because we
          don't have any code that touches these methods outside of their
          containing object we may delete a method or change its parameters but
          none of these changes will impact the rest of the applications code so
          with abstraction we reduce the impact of change now the third core
          concept in object-oriented programming inheritance inheritance is a
          mechanism that allows you to eliminate redundant code here's an
          example think of HTML elements like text boxes drop-down lists
          checkboxes and so on all these elements have a few things in common
          they should have properties like hidden and inner HTML and metals like
          click and focus instead of redefining all these properties and methods
          for every type of HTML element we can define them once in a generic
          object call it HTML element and have other objects inherit these
          properties and methods so inheritance helps us eliminate redundant
          code and finally polymorphism.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Poly</em> means <em>many</em>. <em>More</em> means
          <em>form</em> so polymorphism means many forms. In object-oriented
          programming polymorphism is a technique that allows you to get rid of
          long if else statements or switch and case statements. So back to our
          HTML elements example all these objects should have the ability to be
          rendered on a page but the way each element is rendered is different
          from the others if you want to render multiple HTML elements in a
          procedural way our code would probably look like this.
        </p>
        <p>
          But with object orientation we can implement a render method in each
          of these objects and the render method will behave differently
          depending on the type of the object you're referencing. So we can get
          rid of this nasty switch and case and use one line of code like this
          you will see that later in the course so here are the benefits of
          object oriented programming using encapsulation we group related
          variables and functions together and this way we can reduce complexity
          now we can reuse this object and do from parts of a program or in
          different programs with abstraction we hide the details and the
          complexity and show only the essentials this technique reduces
          complexity and also isolates the impact of changes in the code with
          inheritance we can eliminate redundant code and with polymorphism we
          can refactor ugly switch case statements well hello it's me mash again
          I wanted to say thank you very much for watching this tutorial to the
          end I hope you learned a lot please share and like this video to

        <h1 id="topic-1">Object Oriented Programming Concepts</h1>

        <h2 id="topic-1.1">Encapsulation</h2>

        <p>
          Encapsulation is a process of wrapping code and data together into a
          single unit. Encapsulation is the idea of:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Bundling data and function (logic) together</li>
          <li>
            Exposing an interface whereby other objects can access and use it
          </li>
          <li>Restricting access to certain details</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2 id="topic-1.2">Abstraction</h2>

        <p>
          The client of a class cares about the functionality the class offers,
          but not about how the functionality is implemented. This is referred
          to as data abstraction. Although programmers may know the details of a
          class's implementation, they should not write code that depends on
          these details. This enables a class to be replaced with another
          version without affecting the rest of the system.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 id="topic-1.3">Inheritance</h2>

        <p>
          Inheritance is the ability of classes to inherit attributes and
          methods from other classes. Generalization principle of OOP allows us
          to consider general categories of objects which have common
          properties. It allows the programmer to build a relationship between a
          new class and an existing class and define a new code in terms of
          existing code. In inheritance relationship there are two types of
          classes:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>Superclass/Parent class</em> : The class from where a subclass
            inherits features is called superclass. It is also called base class
            or parent class in java.
          </li>

          <li>
            <em>Subclass/Child class</em> : A class that inherits all the
            members (attributes and methods) from other class is called
            subclass. It is also called a derived class, child class, or
            extended class.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 id="topic-1.4">Polymorphism</h2>

        <p>
          Polymorphism means that similar objects can respond to the same
          message in different ways. For example, you might have a system with
          many shapes. However, a circle, a square, and a star are each drawn
          differently. Using polymorphism, you can send each of these shapes the
          same message (for example, Draw), and each shape is responsible for
          drawing itself.
