        <p>
          Scientists often gather data through observation experiments archival
          studies and so on but they are rarely satisfied with data alone.
          Scientists want to draw conclusions from those data they want to use
          the data to show that certain theories are right and others are wrong
          to understand science then it will be important to understand when it
          is legitimate and when it is illegitimate to draw a specific
          conclusion. From what we already know we need to understand the
          difference between good and bad arguments and that is why in this
          lecture we will take a look at logic the study of argumentation let us
          first introduce some terminology an argument consists of two parts the
          premises and the conclusion the premises are the things we presuppose
          and the conclusion is what we conclude from those premises.
        </p>
        <p>
          So let's look at an example no medieval King had absolute power over
          his subjects Louis 7 of France was a medieval King so Louis 7 of
          France did not have absolute power over his subjects here the first
          two lines are the premises and a final line introduced by the word so
          is the conclusion in this argument we assume that medieval kings did
          not have absolute power and that Louis 7 was a medieval King and we
          conclude that he did not have absolute power as a second piece of
          terminology we will make a distinction between valid and invalid
          arguments a valid argument is an argument in which the conclusion
          really follows from the premises our example about Louis 7 is an
          example of a valid argument the conclusion really follows from the
          premises. It makes sense to draw this conclusion from these premises
          as an example of an invalid argument we can take this know medieval
          King had absolute power over his subjects Louis seven of France was a
          great horseman so Louis seven of France did not have absolute power
          over his subjects we just can't draw that conclusion from those
          premises so this argument is not valid it's invalid note that whether
          an argument is valid or not has nothing to do with whether the
          premises or the conclusions are true perhaps Louis 7 really was a
          great horseman then all the premises and the conclusion of that
          argument are true and yet the argument is invalid because the
          conclusion just doesn't follow from the premises.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand it's also possible to have false premises and a
          valid argument for instance no medieval King had absolute power over
          his subjects Victor high Spurs was a medieval king so Victor fiber's
          did not have absolute power over his subjects this argument is
          perfectly valid even though the assumption that I am a medieval King
          is as far as I know false we can now introduce our final piece of
          terminology the distinction between two kinds of arguments deductive
          arguments and inductive arguments a deductive argument is an argument
          in which the truth of the premises absolutely guarantees the truth of
          the conclusion it's just not possible for the premises to be true and
          the conclusion to be false returning to our original example we can
          see that this is a deductive argument it is true the medieval Kings
          did not have absolute power and if it is true that Louis 7 was a
          medieval King then it must be true that he did not have absolute power
          or in other words if he did have absolute power then one of those two
          premises must be wrong.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'll come to the definition of inductive arguments in a moment but
          first I want to point out two interesting features of deductive
          arguments first if you use deductive arguments you can't make any new
          mistakes the only way for the conclusion of a deductive argument to be
          false is if one of your assumptions is false so if you already believe
          something false then your conclusion may end up being false but if
          your assumptions are true your conclusions are guaranteed to be true
          as well so deductive arguments never introduce fall suits if they
          weren't already there and that makes them very strong and good
          arguments to use because they're not very risky second logicians found
          out already more than 2,000 years ago and Aristotle played an
          important role here that whether a deductive argument is valid or not
          can be determined just by looking at the form of the argument and
          ignoring its content even if you know nothing about medieval kings and
          Louis 7 you can still see that our example argument is valid how
          because there's this form no a is B C is a so C is not B where a is
          medieval King B is someone with absolute power and C is Louis 7 but we
          can put anything we like in the place of those letters and the
          argument will remain valid for instance let's choose a is Dutchman B
          is humble and C is fixed or high Spurs then we have no Dutchman is
          humble Victor high stress is a Dutchman so Victor highest verse is not
          humble which is another valid argument although of course the first
          premise is false and so is the conclusion so we can see whether a
          deductive argument is valid simply by looking at its form without
          knowing anything about its content and that is really important
          because that means that we can see whether something is a good
          argument without making any prior theoretical assumptions about the
          content matter if we believe that scientists first collect data and
          then come to a conclusion about which theories are right and wrong
          this is exactly what we would expect we only need the data and some
          valid arguments which can be shown to be valid independent of any
          theories or ideas and then we draw our conclusions.
        </p>
        <p>
          It would be great if science worked like that unfortunately and I bet
          you saw that coming science doesn't work like that and it doesn't work
          like that because the most important arguments in science are not
          deductive they are inductive remember that a deductive argument is an
          argument such that the truth of the premises absolutely guarantees the
          truth of the conclusion an inductive argument is an argument where the
          truth of the premises gives good reason to believe the conclusion but
          does not absolutely guarantee its truth again let's look at an example
          none of the medieval texts we have studied argues against the
          existence of God so no scholar in the Middle Ages argued against the
          existence of God that's a valid argument if it's true that none of the
          texts we have makes this argument and we have a lot of texts and it's
          quite plausible that nobody in that time actually made this argument
          but it's indeed only plausible it could be that the argument was made
          but somehow it wasn't transmitted to us so in an inductive argument
          the truth of the premises makes the conclusion likely but it doesn't
          guarantee it and that's generally the case in science we have some
          limited data we want to draw a general conclusion from those and our
          data makes the conclusion likely but they don't make it certain so in
          science we are continually making inductive arguments and as we will
          see in the next lecture induction is a lot more problematic than
          deduction.

        <h2 id="proposition">Proposition</h2>

        <p>
          A proposition is a declarative sentence (that is, a sentence that
          declares a fact) that is either true or false, but not both. We use
          letters to denote propositional variables(orsentential variables),
          that is, variables that represent propositions, just as letters are
          used to denote numerical variables. The conventional letters used for
          propositional variables are p, q, r, s, … . The truth value of a
          proposition
        </p>

        <h2 id="rules-of-inference">Rules of Inference</h2>

        <p>
          An argument in propositional logic is a sequence of propositions. All
          but the final proposition in the argument are called premises and the
          final proposition is called the conclusion. An argument is valid if
          the truth of all its premises implies that the conclusion is true. An
          argument form in propositional logic is a sequence of compound
          propositions involving propositional variables. An argument form is
          valid if no matter which particular propositions are substituted for
          the propositional variables in its premises, the conclusion is true if
          the premises are all true.
