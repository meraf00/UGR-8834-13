        <p>
          This course is an in-depth look at object oriented paradigm using the
          popular programming language Java. It is not intended for first time
          programmers. After some preliminaries devoted to basic syntax and
          program structure, classes, composition, inheritance and polymorphism
          are examined. The Java collection classes are studied in some detail,
          as is the rather complex set of I/O classes. Additional topics include
          exception handling, building GUIs with JavaFX, and multi-threading.
          Throughout the second half of the course, a series of homework
          problems develops a non-toy application, illustrating by example how
          larger object-oriented programs are organized.

          <p>
            When you're learning to code do you ever feel like you're stuck
            learning the same thing over and over again? you might watch a
            tutorial video and by the end you feel like you kind of get it 0:09
            but when the next day rolls around you've no clue how any of it
            works anymore so you have to go back and re-watch the tutorial but
            unfortunately this pattern keeps repeating you might feel like none
            of this knowledge is actually sticking in your brain and it can get
            very frustrating to feel like you're not getting anywhere so in this
            video I'm going to cover some common pitfalls that might be tripping
            you up and causing you to waste time when you're learning to code
            now as a disclaimer keep in mind that there are no magical shortcuts
            that will transform you overnight into a coding expert I know, even
            with good learning techniques it's still going to take time to go
            from a beginner developer to a more advanced one
          </p>
          <p>
            Alright let's get into the tips, the first one is don't learn things
            randomly. Figure out a road map to follow if you're jumping around
            trying to learn git one day, CSS custom properties the next and
            javascript promises on the third. You may be setting yourself up for
            a lot of hardship. Instead of picking things at random to learn look
            for a structured path that you can follow one path you can use is a
            video on my channel called learn web development for absolute
            beginners. It shows you a simplified roadmap of the main skills that
            you'll need to learn and the order to learn them in you can also go
            through an online bootcamp curriculum like FreeCodeCamp, Zero to
            Mastery or Ania Kub√≥w's 12 hour bootcamp on HTML, CSS and
            JavaScript. The benefit of following a pre-made path is that you'll
            know what you need to learn and when and as you go from one step to
            the next, you'll be able to see your progress and feel like you're
            actually getting somewhere. Now as you're following your path you
            might be tempted to try to learn multiple things at the same time in
            order to get through everything more quickly but doing this may
            actually divide your attention and make it harder for that knowledge
            to stick.
          </p>
          <p>
            So tip number two is don't try to learn everything all at once but
            focus on learning one thing at a time. I recommend staying on one
            subject until you feel you have a decent grasp of the basics at
            least. When you're starting out, for example, let's say you're
            learning html first once you feel like you know most of the common
            tags and can build a very basic html web page you can move on to
            learning CSS then in the future if you come across an html tag that
            you're not familiar with you can take some time to learn about that
            specific tag.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tip number three, be an active learner. Don't just passively consume
            content sitting back and watching an instructor go through the
            material without trying anything yourself is not going to get you
            very far. Instead, try to do some combination of taking a new
            information and then trying it yourself in real life for example I
            went through Wes Bos's CSS grid course back when I was first
            learning about grid what I did was I would watch the video and try
            to code along with wes through the lessons if I didn't fully
            understand something I would go back and watch it again and after
            each lesson I would pause the course and try to build the lesson
            examples on my own without looking back as much as possible this
            trying to create what you've just learned without looking at the
            source code is a great way to see how much you actually remember and
            it'll very quickly help you identify the weak points in your
            knowledge so you can then go back and fill it in after the course
            was done I felt like I had a basic grasp of CSS grid but I wouldn't
            consider myself an expert by any definition and I think that's okay
            because I could try to use grid when building website layouts and if
            I ever got stuck on anything I could refer back to the course or
            other resources like Mozilla Developer Network learning new skills
            and coding is a combination of learning the knowledge and putting it
            into practice which brings me to tip number four don't just memorize
            stuff.
          </p>
          <p>
            Remember back in school, when you were learning vocabulary words and
            history dates you might have studied lists of facts and memorized
            them so that you could regurgitate them for tests and quizzes. Now
            I'm not here to debate the pros and cons of rote memorization,
            however, trying to learn html by just memorizing lists of all the
            html tags is not going to be very effective. Coding is an applicable
            skill not just a collection of abstract facts. Obviously, you do
            need to be able to remember things in order to use them but you're
            going to learn flexbox a lot faster if you explore all the different
            properties by playing around in a code pen for a day or two as
            opposed to just memorizing the definition of flex grow no web
            developer is going to know everything off the top of their head. I
            can attest to this as someone who worked in the industry for a long
            time and worked with other professional developers. We all used
            Google or DuckDuckGo if you care about your privacy to look up stuff
            constantly in a way Stack Overflow, MDN, and CSS Tricks become kind
            of like an extension of your brain. The goal of all this is to be
            able to build websites and if you need to look up stuff along the
            way that's perfectly fine everyone does it and that brings me to tip
            number five, build stuff!
          </p>
          <p>
            I know everyone says this but it really is the best way to learn.
            Coding watching tutorials and going through courses is the beginning
            not the end of learning web development. At my first web dev job I
            would be given a project like building a landing page with a button
            and getting it to submit to a database now since this was my job I
            had to build it I didn't really have a choice. And oftentimes I'll
            be given a task that I had no idea how to do scary right the only
            solution was to jump right in and try my best I would look stuff up
            and try things on my own and ask for help when I really was stuck.
            Even though the process of figuring this all out may have been very
            painful at times it was all worth it in the end when I got to look
            at my finished website and this is one big benefit of learning by
            building projects. Having a tangible goal in front of you is great
            because when you reach it you'll feel like you've really achieved
            something if you're looking for project ideas don't worry because
            there are tons of them on the internet search for things like
            "javascript project ideas" or "react project ideas" you get the
            picture and personally I always recommend FrontendMentor.io for
            front-end projects that are also great additions to your portfolio
            I've built a few Frontend Mentor projects on my channel and if
            you're interested you can check out Building a Responsive Website
            from Scratch and more recently, Building a Social Media Dashboard
            with a Dark/Light Toggle and if you do watch these don't forget to
            code along with me as you watch anyway if you're currently learning
            to code I really hope that this video has been helpful for you let
            me know down in the comments what you thought and if you have any
            more tips that you found useful feel free to share those as well so
            thanks for watching and we'll see you in the next one
